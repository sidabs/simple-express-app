# simple-express-app
This is a simple express app.  I'm using this for playing around with deployment automation tools (ansible, chef, puppet, etc).

##Setup Instructions
###NPM Install
after cloning, go into the root directory and execute `npm install`
###Launching
once you've installed all the necessary npm modules (defined in `package.json`), you can start by executing `npm start`
